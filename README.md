# PTP Protocol
A Python application to simulate TCP but has congestion control removed. All of this code was built from scratch and no code duplication from other resources.

Utilises multithreading as well.

**What is implemented**: 

- Three way handshake
- Connection termination
- Fast retransmit on triple duplicate ACK
-  Packet loss simulator
- Logs of packets sent (like Wireshark)
