# PTP Protocol

**How it works**: Uses the same principles as TCP but its main application is to transfer data without congestion control. 

**What is implemented**: 

- Three way handshake
- Connection termination
- Fast retransmit on triple duplicate ACK
-  Packet loss simulator
- Logs of packets sent (like Wireshark)
